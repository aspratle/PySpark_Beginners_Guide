### About
Join me on the journey in learning more about PySpark and demonstrating these skills through projects. I plan on tapping into tons of open data sets to demonstrate different PySpark skills/ML Models.  

### Getting Started 

View the [Intro Slide Deck](https://github.com/aspratle/PySpark_Beginners_Guide/blob/main/Intro_PySpark_SlideDeck.pdf) in this repo to learn what PySpark is by definition and key components to PySpark.  

Start with the first notebook (it will be the simplest) to practice data manipulation and exploratory data analysis: [NYC Water Consumption Notebook](https://github.com/aspratle/PySpark_Beginners_Guide/blob/main/NYC_Water_Consumption_EDA.ipynb)
